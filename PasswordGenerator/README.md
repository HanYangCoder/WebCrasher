![Progress](/assets/progress2.png)

This is a simple password generator app that generates a random password with the length of 8-25 characters.

### Algorithm:
1. The app randomly generates first a lowercase and uppercase letter, a number, and a special character as the first four characters of the password to ensure password has all 4 types of characters.

2. Afterwards, every character generated has these chances of being generated:
40% - Lowercase letter
30% - Uppercase letter
20% - Number
10% - Special character

3. The app shuffles all the characters in the generated password to ensure randomness in the newly generated password

To do's:
- Fix CSS styling for front-end
